# Explanation
1. Creating Directories: The create_directory function ensures that the models directory exists before saving the model file.
2. Generating Random Data: Random training data (X_train and y_train) is generated using NumPy. The training data consists of 100 samples with 10 features each, and corresponding target values.
3. Creating and Training the Model: A RandomForestRegressor model is created and trained on the generated data.
4. Saving the Model: The trained model is saved to a file named random_forest.pkl using joblib.
5. Running the Script
To run the script, save it to a Python file (e.g., generate_random_forest_model.py) and execute it:python generate_random_forest_model.py
